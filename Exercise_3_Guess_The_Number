You have to build a "Number Guessing Game," in which a winning number is set to some integer
value. The Program should take input from the user, and if the entered number is less
than the winning number, a message should display that the number is smaller and
vice versa.
'''

# Instructions:
# 1. You are free to use anything we've studied till now.
# 2. The number of guesses should be limited, i.e (5 or 9).
# 3. Print the number of guesses left.
# 4. Print the number of guesses he took to win the game.
# 5. “Game Over” message should display if the number of guesses becomes equal to 0.

print("Number Guessing Game")
nog=1
n=12
while nog<=9:
    var1 = int(input("Guess the Number"))
    if var1>12:
        print("Guess Lower")
    elif var1<12:
        print("Guess Higher")
    else:
        print("You Guessed the right number")
        print("Number of chance taken",nog)
        break
    print(9-nog ,"No of Chances left")
    nog=nog+1
if nog>7:
    print("game over")
